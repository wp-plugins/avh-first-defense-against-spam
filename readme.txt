== Description ==

The AVH First Defense Against Spam plugin gives you the ability to block spammers before any content is served.
Spammers are identified by checking if the visitors IP exists in a database served by stopforumspam.com or by a local blacklist.


= Features =
* Based on the frequency a spammer has been reported at stopforumspam.com, a separate threshold can be set for the following features:
	* Send an email to the board administrator with information about the spammer.
	* Block the spammer before content is server.
* Block spammers that access wp-comments-post.php directly by using a comment security check. An email can be send when the check fails.
* Block visitors based on IP address by using a local blacklist.
* Bypass the checks for the IP at Stop Forum Spam and the local blacklist based on IP in the local whitelist.
* Ability to add single IP's and/or IP ranges to the blacklist and whitelist.
* When an IP is blocked a message can be displayed to the visitor with the reason why access was blocked and a link to stopforumspam.com if they want to resolve the issue.
* Report a spammer to Stop Forum Spam. A valid API key from Stop Forum Spam is necessary.
* Add a spammer to the local blacklist by clicking a link in the received email.

 
Blocking a potential spammer before content is served has the following advantages:

1. It saves bandwidth.
1. It saves CPU cycles. The spammer is actually checked and blocked before WordPress starts building the page.
1. If you keep track of how many visitors your site has, either by using Google's Analytics, WP-Stats or any other one, it will give you a cleaner statistic of visits your site receives. 

To my knowledge this plugin is fully compatible with other anti-spam plugins, I have tested it with WP-Spamfree and Akismet.

The plugin also gives you some extra tips and tricks to stop spam by editing your htaccess file. To access them go to the settings of the plugin and click Tips and Tricks.
If you have more tricks feel free to email them to me and I will add them in the Tips and Tricks section with full credits of course.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this plugin enough to block all spam? =
Unfortunately not.
I don't believe there is one solution to block all spam. Personally I have great success with the plugin in combination with Akismet.

= Does it conflicts with other spam solutions? =
I'm currently not aware of any conflicts with other anti-spam solutions.

= How do I define a range in the blacklist or white list? =
You can define two sorts of ranges:
From IP to IP. i.e. 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.105
A network in CIDR format. i.e. 192.168.1.0/24

= How do I report a spammer to Stop Forum Spam? =
You need to have an API key from Stop Forum Spam. If you do on the Edit Comments pages there is an extra option called, Report & Delete, in the messages identified as spam.

= How do I get a Stop Forum Spam API key? =
You will have to sign up on their site, http://www.stopforumspam.com/signup.
